 * Exercise 1 - How does async/await help with performance and scalability?
 */

/*

Async/await can help improve performance and scalability by allowing your
application to do other work while it is waiting for a task to complete.
This can help avoid bottlenecks and keep your application responsive. 
Additionally, using async/await can help reduce the overall amount of 
code needed to be written, making your application easier to maintain.

It allows a program to run a function without freezing the entire program
