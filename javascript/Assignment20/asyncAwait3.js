Real world use of async/await:

- On server-side applications async can increase scalability of web servers
- Web applications that need to load data from multiple sources simultaneously
- Chat applications that need to send and receive messages in real-time
- Games that need to perform complex calculations in the background 
  while still providing a responsive experience to the user
