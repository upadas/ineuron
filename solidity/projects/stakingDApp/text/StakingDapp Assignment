For the full stack staking Dapp that we have created in the Live class, you need to add the following functionalities to the existing Dapp.

1) Create the user interface in the client application to claim the Reward Tokens as per the smart contract
2) Create the user interface to withdraw tokens and update the balance of user's Mumbai testnet account.
3) If possible, try to show the reward tokens earned by a particular account in real time on the client side application.
